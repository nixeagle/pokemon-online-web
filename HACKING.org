This is a quick overview on where things are within the webclient.

The flow of information from user to the pokemon online server looks like this:

  webclient -> python server -> pokemon online server

The webclient side of this handles the look and feel of the client. This
reads in json from the python server and acts on it as well as sends
json back out to the server for commands.

The python server is in charge of translating the json commands from
the webclient into PO's native binary format.


Looking at specific files:
 - poprotocol/protocol.py :: implements the PO binary protocol. This
      is a library that is included by server.py.
 - server.py :: handles translating json to PO's protocol and
      back. This file is full of =onXXX= functions, both for sending
      to the PO server and receiving data from the PO server.
 - static/network.js :: provides the javascript api for sending
      messages to the PO server. Additionally includes a "hook" system
      for handling incoming events.
 - static/ui.js :: provides the actual user interface and is of
                   interest to those wishing to work on the user
                   facing portion of the webclient.
